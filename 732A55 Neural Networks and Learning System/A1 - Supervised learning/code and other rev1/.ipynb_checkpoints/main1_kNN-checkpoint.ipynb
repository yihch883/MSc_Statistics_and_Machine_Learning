    "\n",
    "k-nearest neighbors (kNN) is a relatively simple classification algorithm, that nevertheless can be quite effective. It is a nonlinear classifier where each new sample is assigned the class that most commonly appears among its neighbors in the training data, i.e. those training samples with the shortest distance to it. Distances in kNN can actually be defined in many different ways based on the application, but here we will use the most common Euclidean distance. The number of neighboring samples to consider, called k, is the only parameter of the algorithm. Depending on the specific properties of the problem, different values of k might give optimal results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other types of classifiers, such as support vector machines and neural networks, kNN does not have any trainable parameters, and thus requires no training. It does, however, require a training dataset, which is effectively \"memorized\", and used as reference to classify all future data. This has the advantage of no training time, but results in slow inference times, which are proportional to the amount of training data."

    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the Euclidean distances between every point in `X` and every point in `XTrain` and save them in a large matrix. Recall that the Eucliden distance between two $N$-dimensional points $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ is given as\n",

Because of this, it is recommended that you try to avoid loops as much as possible, and instead take full advantage of `numpy`'s capacity for operating directly on arrays and [broadcasting](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html) arrays. Some loops will likely be necessary, but you will see performance gains if you try to minimize their use."

    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, different values of `k` might work better or worse for each dataset. However, in order to establish which value is best for each dataset it is not enough to run kNN once for each `k` and select the one that gives the highest accuracy. This approach would not take into account the variations in performance that result from the random splitting of training and test data. Results obtained in this way will not reflect the performance that can be expected when the algorithm is applied on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to thoroughly test which value of `k` is best we can resort to cross-validation methods, which rely on repeatedly testing the model on different splits of the data in order to assess its generalization performance. In particular, we will focus on n-fold cross-validation. In this method, we will first reserve a portion of the data for testing, `XTest`, which we will not touch until the very end, and use the remaining data `XTrain` for cross-validation. `XTrain` will again be split into `N` bins, which corresponds with the number of times that the kNN algorithm will be run for each value of `k`. For each iteration, one bin is used as validation data `XValCV`, and all the remaining bins are combined and used as training data `XTrainCV`. This will result in `N` accuracies for each value of `k`, which we will average to obtain the **average cross-validation accuracy**, which is the relevant metric for determining the optimal `k`. The higher the value of `N`, the more precise will be our determination of the accuracy of different values of `k`. This picture illustrates 3-fold cross validation for one value of `k`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Start by splitting the available data into training and test `splitData` function as before. Then, use the function `splitDataBins` to further split the training data into `N` bins. Finally, use the funciton `getCVSplit` to combine the data bins into `XTrainCV` and `XValCV`. This function takes in the degree of cross validation `N` and the current iteration of the cross validation `i`, indicating which bin will be used for the validation data (note that this is zero-indexed). Three-fold cross-validation should be a minimum, but do not be afraid to try using more bins, e.g. 50-100, as the resulting inference time increases less than linearly."

By rewriting the computation of the Euclidean distance in a clever way, and using the full capabilities of numpy broadcasting, it is possible to compute the distance matrix without a single loop. This solution is incredibly fast and therefore enables high degree cross validation over many values of k. Your optional task is to rewrite your implementation to have no loops, and to rerun the cross validation."
